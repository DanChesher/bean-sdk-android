# SDK Doc Deployment

The SDK docs are hosted on this repo's GitHub Pages site.

In the future, they will be deployed automatically via CircleCI. For now, run the following **inside this directory** to deploy these docs to GitHub Pages:


## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Build and Deploy Docs

```bash
npm run gulp deploy
```
